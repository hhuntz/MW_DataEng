This script pulls constituent data from AWS S3 buckets and creates CSVs as outlined [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jhQxhGVmxVF8MlsUnSITVxIjGwEOxJnr/edit#heading=h.1fob9te)

This script was written and tested with pandas 1.5.2
It requires an internet connection to access AWS S3 buckets.

All output files are written directly to the working directory, not necessarily to the repo directory.
